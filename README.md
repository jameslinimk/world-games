## World-games (or Worldimik)
# [Click here to view the website](https://jameslinimk.github.io/world-games/)
This is a game where you try to guess countries on a world map. So far there is only 1 gamemode (guess), but the code is structured to add many more easily.

## Compiling yourself
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies
3. Run either `npm run dev` to run a hot-reload localhost site, or `npm run build` to compile the code into HTML and JS.

## World map
The world map is taken from [here](https://github.com/raphaellepuschitz/SVG-World-Map) (thanks!)
